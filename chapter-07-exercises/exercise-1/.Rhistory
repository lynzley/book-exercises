# Exercise 1: creating and accessing lists
# Create a vector `my_breakfast` of everything you ate for breakfast

### Challenge ###
# Create a list that has the number of items you ate for each meal
# Hint: use the `lappy()` function to apply the `length()` function to each item
num_items <- list(lapply(meals, length))
# Write a function `add_pizza` that adds pizza to a given meal vector, and
# returns the pizza-fied vector
add_pizza <- function(meal) {
new_value <- meal$pizza
return(new_value)
}
# Create a vector `better_meals` that is all your meals, but with pizza!
better_meals <- c(add_pizza(meals))
# Create a vector of 100 employees ("Employee 1", "Employee 2", ... "Employee 100")
# Hint: use the `paste()` function and vector recycling to add a number to the word
# "Employee"
hundredIemployees <- c(paste("Employee", seq(1, 100)))
